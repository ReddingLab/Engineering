# Valve mounts for microscope

The mounts are meant to slot into two 25 mm Optical Construction Rails (ThorLabs #XE25L09 or similar). The width is set for the rails to be mounted 4 inches apart.

* 2_pos_2_way_mount.stl is made to mount IDEX #V-100L (also requires stickum)
* 2_pos_6_way_mount.stl is made to mount IDEX #V-450 
* Spacer.stl is just to bring the mounts up off the table for easier use.
